# DAOstack Arc.js

[DAOstack Arc.js](https://github.com/daostack/arc.js) sits just above [DAOstack Arc](https://github.com/daostack/arc) on the DAO stack.  It is a library that facilitates javascript application access to the DAOstack Arc ethereum smart contracts.

For more information about Arc contracts and the entire DAOstack ecosystem, please refer to the [Arc documentation](https://daostack.github.io/arc/README/).

## Installation

Ensure that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), v9.4.0 or greater, is installed.

Install the npm package into your project:

```script
npm install @daostack/arc.js --save
```

Now you can proceed with migrating contracts to a running testnet and configuring Arc.js in your application and environment.

## API Reference
You can find a [detailed reference for the entire Arc.js API here](/api/README.md).  Read on here for step-by-step examples on how to get started with Arc.js.

## Setting up Arc.js

The following sections describe the basic steps for setting up Arc.js in your application. These steps basically involve:

1. running a blockchain node.  We will use the ganache testnet as an example.
2. deploying the Arc contracts to the net
3. using the Arc.js code in your application

!!! note
    All of the script examples assume you are running the scripts in the root folder of your application.  If you happen to be running the scripts in the context of a cloned Arc.js repository, omit the prefix `npm explore @daostack/arc.js -- `. See [more about working with Arc.js Scripts](#working-with-arcjs-scripts).

## Setting up a Testnet with Arc Contracts

Arc.js runs against an Ethereum network where it assumes that the Arc contracts have been migrated.  Out of the box, Arc.js can find contracts migrated to the mainnet. But for testing, you will need to tell it to migrate the Arc contracts to a testnet of your choice.  You can do this by running a few Arc.js scripts.

To deploy contracts to a Ganache testnet, run the following scripts:

In a separate shell window:
```script
npm explore @daostack/arc.js -- npm start test.ganache.run
```

If you are running the migration for the first time:

```script
npm explore @daostack/arc.js -- npm start migrateContracts.fetchFromArc
```

Now migrate the Arc contracts to Ganache:

```script
npm explore @daostack/arc.js -- npm start migrateContracts
```

Now when your app uses Arc.js, it will be running against Ganache and the contracts you just migrated.

For more on Arc.js scripts, see [Working with Arc.js Scripts](#working-with-arcjs-scripts).

See [Deploying to Other Testnets](#deploying-to-other-testnets) if you want to run against a testnet other-than Ganache.

## Using the Arc.js Library in your Code

### Typescript
Arc.js itself is written using Typescript. The Arc.js library includes Typescript type definitions defined in an index.d.ts.

### JavaScript
The javascript included in the Arc.js library is ES6 in a commonjs module format.

### Importing Arc.js

Import everything from ArcJs as follows:

```javascript
import * as ArcJs from '@daostack/arc.js';
```
### Configuring Arc.js

Please refer [here](./Configuration.md) for complete documentation on configuration settings.

To obtain a configuration setting:

```javascript
import { ConfigService } from '@daostack/arc.js';
ConfigService.get('network');
```

To override a configuration setting at runtime:
```javascript
import { ConfigService } from '@daostack/arc.js';
ConfigService.set('network', 'kovan');
```

!!! tip
    You can also override the defaults using OS environment variables.

### Initializing Arc.js at Runtime

Your application must invoke `ArcInitialize()` once at runtime before doing anything else.

```javascript
import { ArcInitialize } from "@daostack/arc.js";
await ArcInitialize();
```

### Working with Arc Contracts
Now that you've got Arc.js plugged into your application, configured, and contracts migrated to a running testnet, you are ready to start coding against DAOs and other Arc entities.

You will likely start by creating or referencing one more DAOs.  Arc.js provides a class called [DAO](api/classes/DAO) that facilitates creating and working with DAOs.  Refer here for [all about the DAO class](DAOs).

Once you have a DAO or set of DAOs, you can start working with them, most often using schemes to work with proposals. Arc.js facilitates working with proposals, schemes and other entities such as global constraints and voting machines by providing contract "wrapper" classes.  Refer here for [all about wrapper classes](Wrappers).

### Other Service Classes

Arc.js provides a few "service" classes that can be helpful, including:

- [AvatarService](api/classes/AvatarService) - provides info about a given Avatar.
- [ConfigService](api/classes/ConfigService) - for working with Arc.js configuration settings. [Read more here](Configuration.md).
- [LoggingService](api/classes/LoggingService) - for logging.  See also the [`logLevel` configuration setting](Configuration.md).
- [Utils](api/classes/Utils) - miscellaneous API for working with web3, truffle contracts and transactions.
