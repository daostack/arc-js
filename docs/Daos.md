# Working with DAOs

Arc.js provides a class called [DAO](api/classes/DAO) that facilitates creating and working with DAOs.  Read on for more information.

## About DAOs

Every DAO has an architecture defined by Arc that enables it to use the reusable contracts provided by Arc.  Each DAO has an avatar, a controller, a token, a reputation system, a set of schemes and global constraints.

The avatar is a public-facing part of the DAO that handles the interaction of the DAO with the rest of the world, for example interacting with other DAOs or paying third party agents.  A DAO is always referenced using the address of its avatar.

Schemes are the contracts that agents use when they want to work with proposals respecting the DAO.  Each scheme has a voting machine (or like [GenesisProtocol](api/classes/GenesisProtocolWrapper), is itself a scheme).

Global constraints use configured criteria to potentially block any action attempted by the Controller.  An example is [TokenCapGC](api/classes/TokenCapGCWrapper) that limits the total supply of a given token to a certain maximum number.

The controller is a central internal hub for all of the components of the DAO.

DAOs are extensible beyond the reusable contracts that Arc supplies: You can provide your own implementation of the controller, token, and any global constraints and schemes you want.

## Creating a new DAO

When creating a DAO you can configure its name, token, founders and schemes.  Of each scheme, you configure the parameters, permissions and voting machine.

You will call [DAO.new](api/classes/DAO#new) to create a new DAO, passing it a [configuration object](api/interfaces/NewDaoConfig).

Almost everything in the configuration has a default.  The following sections describe how to supply configurations for all the configurable parts.

### Creating a new DAO with all defaults

The simplest example of how to create a new DAO uses all defaults:  No schemes nor founders:

```javascript
const newDao = await DAO.new({
  name: "My New DAO",
  tokenName: "My new Token",
  tokenSymbol: "MNT"
});
```

And voil√†, you have created a new DAO in the DAO stack on Ethereum.  The returned object `newDao` is an instance of [DAO](api/classes/DAO) and you are off and running.  But you won't run far without schemes and founders who can make proposals and vote on them -- no one can vote on a proposal without having some reputation.

### Creating a new DAO with founders

Create a new DAO with founders by including a "founders" array.  This will automatically mint tokens and reputation to each founder:

```javascript
const newDao = await DAO.new({
  name: "My New DAO",
  tokenName: "My new Token",
  tokenSymbol: "MNT",
  founders: [
    {
      // the current user
      address: accounts[0],
      reputation: web3.toWei(1000),
      tokens: web3.toWei(40)
    },
    {
      address: founder1Address,
      reputation: web3.toWei(1000),
      tokens: web3.toWei(40)
    },
    {
      address: founder2Address,
      reputation: web3.toWei(1000),
      tokens: web3.toWei(40)
    }
  ]
});
```

!!! note
    It is not possible to add or remove founders.  In fact, there is no retained sense of who they ever were.  They are simply addresses you supply when you create a DAO and to whom will immediately be minted tokens and reputation.

So this DAO has founders with tokens and reputation, but no way to make proposals, thus nothing on which to vote.  The DAO needs some schemes, at minimum a [SchemeRegistrar](api/classes/SchemeRegistrarWrapper) with which you can propose to add, modify or remove other schemes.

### Creating a new DAO with schemes

Create a new DAO with schemes by including a "schemes" array.  The following example registers the schemes with all default parameters, permissions and voting machines.

```javascript
const newDao = await DAO.new({
  name: "My New DAO",
  tokenName: "My new Token",
  tokenSymbol: "MNT",
  schemes: [
    { name: "SchemeRegistrar" },
    { name: "UpgradeScheme" },
    { name: "GlobalConstraintRegistrar" }
  ]
});
```

Put the last two examples together and you have a DAO with founders and schemes. Now you can _really_ go places.

What if we want to configure how voting will proceed when someone submits a proposal?

### Creating a new DAO overriding the default voting machine

By default, `DAO.new` configures each scheme with the [AbsoluteVote](api/classes/AbsoluteVoteWrapper) voting machine and default voting parameter values.  The following example retains the default voting machine while overriding its parameters:


```javascript
const newDao = await DAO.new({
  name: "My New DAO",
  tokenName: "My new Token",
  tokenSymbol: "MNT",
  votingMachineParams: {
    votePerc: 45,
    ownerVote: false
  }
});
```

Here we supply an alternate voting machine address, supplying it AbsoluteVote parameters:

```javascript
const newDao = await DAO.new({
  name: "My New DAO",
  tokenName: "My new Token",
  tokenSymbol: "MNT",
  votingMachineParams: {
    votePerc: 45,
    ownerVote:false
    votingMachineAddress: anAddress
  }
});
```

Here we supply a different default voting machine ([GenesisProtocol](api/classes/GenesisProtocolWrapper)), with default voting parameters:

```javascript
const newDao = await DAO.new({
  name: "My New DAO",
  tokenName: "My new Token",
  tokenSymbol: "MNT",
  votingMachineParams: {
    votingMachineName: "GenesisProtocol"
  }
});
```

!!! tip
    If you want change the default for all calls to `DAO.new` you can do it using the ConfigService setting "defaultVotingMachine". See [Arc.js Configuration Settings](Configuration.md).

!!! note "Important"
    If you want to use GenesisProtocol on _any_ scheme, you must also add GenesisProtocol as scheme on the DAO itself (see [Creating a new DAO with schemes](#creating-a-new-dao-with-schemes)).

Here we override the default voting machine parameters on just one of the schemes:

```javascript
const newDao = await DAO.new({
  name: "My New DAO",
  tokenName: "My new Token",
  tokenSymbol: "MNT",
  schemes: [
    { name: "SchemeRegistrar" },
    { name: "UpgradeScheme" },
    {
      name: "GlobalConstraintRegistrar",
      votingMachineParams: {
        votePerc: 30,
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

### Creating a new DAO with a non-Universal Controller

There are two types of DAO controller: universal and non-universal.  The default is universal.  You can create a DAO using the DAOstack `Controller` contract by passing `false` for `universalController`:

```javascript
const newDao = await DAO.new({
  name: "My New DAO",
  tokenName: "My new Token",
  tokenSymbol: "MNT",
  universalController: false
});
```

!!! info
    For more information about choosing between universal and non-universal controllers, see [this article](https://daostack.github.io/arc/contracts/controller/UController/).

### Creating a new DAO with a non-default DaoCreator scheme

In Arc, a DAO is created by the contract called `DaoCreator`.  You can supply your own alternative `DaoCreator` scheme by passing its address in `daoCreatorScheme`:

```javascript
const newDao = await DAO.new({
  name: "My New DAO",
  tokenName: "My new Token",
  tokenSymbol: "MNT",
  daoCreatorScheme: anAddress
});
```

!!! note
    Your alternative contract must implement the same ABI as the Arc `DaoCreator` contract shipped with the running version of Arc.js.

### Get a previously-created DAO

Use [DAO.at](api/classes/DAO#at) to get a previously-created DAO using the avatar address:

```javascript
const dao = await DAO.at(daoAvatarAddress);
```

!!! info
    `DAO.at` will throw an exception if there is any problem loading the DAO.

### Get all the schemes registered to the DAO
You can obtain the addresses of all of the schemes that are registered with a DAO using [DAO.getSchemes](api/classes/DAO/#getSchemes).  You will also get contract wrapper if the scheme is the one deployed by the running version of Arc.js:

```javascript
const daoSchemeInfos = await myDao.getSchemes();
for (let schemeInfo of daoSchemeInfos) {
  console.log(`scheme address: ${schemeInfo.address}`);
  if (schemeInfo.wrapper) {
    console.log(`scheme name: ${schemeInfo.wrapper.name}`);
  }
}
```

Or info about a single scheme:

```javascript
const daoSchemeInfos =  = await myDao.getSchemes("UpgradeScheme");
const upgradeSchemeInfo = daoSchemeInfos[0];
console.log(`scheme address: ${upgradeSchemeInfo.address}`);
if (upgradeSchemeInfo.wrapper) {
  console.log(`scheme name: ${upgradeSchemeInfo.wrapper.name}`);
}
```

### Get the DAOstack Genesis DAO

The DAOstack DAO is named "Genesis".  Use [DAO.getGenesisDao](api/classes/DAO#getGenesisDao) to obtain its address like this:

```javascript
const genesisDaoAddress = await DAO.getGenesisDao();
```
